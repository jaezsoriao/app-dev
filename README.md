# **The Hunger Games Trilogy**
***May the Odds Be Ever In Your Favor***

*In a dystopian future set in the fictional nation of Panem ruled by a defiled dictatorial and authoritarian government, an annual bloodbath ceremony known as the Hunger Games is held; a cruel “sport” where children of ages twelve through eighteen from the 12 districts are made to fight to the death for the amusement of the wealthy Capitol elites. Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl forged by hunger and loss, steps into the arena to save her beloved sister. She then finds herself ensnared in a battle for survival that will quickly ignite a rebellion, and became a symbol of defiance, sparking the revolution in a world that burns with injustice.*
